            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
            <p>I am 25 and have a positive approach to life, at the age of 21 I was diagnosed with an inherited genetic disease called Friedrich's Ataxia. My mobility deteriorated and I am now a wheelchair user. 
                My original plan was to work in the motorsport industry and I studied motorsports mechanics at West Kent College, achieving a level 3 diploma at a merit grade. Soon after completing this I lost my mobility, so I had to put my thinking cap on and work out what I was going to do with my life and work. 
                I have always been better at learning when i get myself stuck into a project rather than th theory side to learning. I can't wait to expand my skills using Treehouse.</p>

            <h2>What I have learn't at Treehouse</h2>
            <p>So far on my course we have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. My favourite part is building the &lt;main&gt; of each web page, I love seeing a site come together.</p>
            <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have used the program Slack a few times to ask questions on a few things i didnt understand throughout the courses and workshops I have already completed. Slack is fantastic! it's a great way to connect with other people on your course and also Treehouse tutors. I love to learn new skills and share what I know with others.</p>
